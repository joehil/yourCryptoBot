# yourCryptoBot

The intention of this software is to do automatic trading of cryptocurrencies in several exchanges (at the moment you can use Bitpanda, Bitstamp, CEX.IO and Kraken without gocryptotrader, and you can also use Binance under the condition that you also install gocryptotrader -- https://github.com/thrasher-corp/gocryptotrader). 

As soon as yourCryptoBot is installed (for example on a raspberry pi) and fully customized it will automatically buy and sell cryptocurrencies for you and make sure that this is done in a way that you earn money. 

We do in no way give any guarantees about the amount that you can earn using yourCryptoBot. You use yourCryptoBot solely at your own risk.
